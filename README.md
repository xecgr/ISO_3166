# ISO-3166 Country, IATA airpots
These lists are the result of merging data from two sources, the Wikipedia ISO 3166-1 article for alpha and numeric country codes, and the UN Statistics site for countries' regional, and sub-regional codes. In addition to countries, it includes dependent territories.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) site provides partial data (capitalised and sometimes stripped of non-latin ornamentation), but sells the complete data set as a Microsoft Access 2003 database. Other sites give you the numeric and character codes, but there appeared to be no sites that included the associated UN-maintained regional codes in their data sets. I scraped data from the above two websites that is all publicly available already to produce some ready-to-use complete data sets that will hopefully save someone some time who had similar needs.

It also includes IATA airports with all relevant information about them
